# OnlineStoreAngular14

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.13.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.




## Testing Strategy in `online-store-angular-14`

In the development of `online-store-angular-14`, we encountered a common challenge during the testing phase, specifically with Angular components that rely on other components or directives. A notable instance of this issue was the `ERROR: 'NG0304: 'app-header' is not a known element` error, which occurs when Angular's testing environment is not aware of the `app-header` component used within the `AppComponent`'s template.

### The Problem

The error message:

ERROR: 'NG0304: 'app-header' is not a known element (used in the 'AppComponent' component template):

If 'app-header' is an Angular component, then verify that it is part of an @NgModule where this component is declared.


This error typically indicates that the testing module setup does not include the declaration or import necessary to recognize the `app-header` component. In a complex Angular application like `online-store-angular-14`, components often depend on other components, modules, or directives, making isolated testing challenging without proper module imports.

### Our Solution

To address this and similar issues, we adopted a comprehensive testing strategy that involves importing the entire `AppModule` in our component tests, as demonstrated in `src\app\app.component.spec.ts`. This approach ensures that all components, directives, and services declared or imported in the `AppModule` are available in the testing environment, thus eliminating the `NG0304` error.

#### Advantages of Importing `AppModule`

- **Consistency**: By mirroring the application's runtime environment in tests, we ensure that components interact as they would in production, providing a more accurate test scenario.
- **Simplicity**: This method abstracts the complexity of managing multiple declarations and imports for each test, making the test setup cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Scalability**: As the project grows, the testing setup remains robust and adaptable, requiring minimal adjustments to accommodate new components or modules.

### Implementation in `app.component.spec.ts`

The key part of our implementation in `app.component.spec.ts` is as follows:

```typescript
beforeEach(async () => {
    await TestBed.configureTestingModule({
        imports: [
            RouterTestingModule,
            AppModule // Importing the entire AppModule
        ],
        declarations: [
            AppComponent // Declaring the component under test
        ],
    }).compileComponents();
});




By importing AppModule, we ensure that all dependencies of AppComponent, including the app-header component, are correctly recognized and instantiated during testing, thereby resolving the NG0304 error.

Conclusion
This testing strategy not only resolves the immediate issue of unrecognized elements in component templates but also sets a foundation for a more integrated and realistic testing environment. It aligns with our commitment to building a robust, maintainable, and scalable online-store-angular-14 project. ```
